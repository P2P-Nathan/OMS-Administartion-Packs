# OMS-Administartion-Packs
Packs to allow easier control of OMS features and usage.

Please add features and correct bugs as you find a Community need for them

Notes on the Current Pack:
 - The Pack has been refactored to removed company specific information from the first version.
 - The Pack Functionality is there and the Process works but a few wrinkles could be ironed out
    * UI could have a slightly more clear process / Goal
    * Documentation is Needed
    * Reporting on Management Pack Changes is Missing
    * Potential hiccups when multiple packs change and users selectivly update.
